### How to run examples on storm or edros server

- I highly recommend you install a local, terminal-like environment of C/C++ and Python3 on your local machine.

- If you cannot install a local environment, please follow the following toturial to use our storm or edros servers. 


For windows users, please install [Git-Scm](https://git-scm.com/download/win). 

For Mac/Linux users, please use your terminal for the following steps. 

---
- On your laptop, creat a folder named CISC4615 (on the desktop) and inside it, create a folder named lab1, and then, download the sample codes into lab1 folder.

- After the installation, please double click to open git-bash.exe(open terminal if you are using Mac/Linux).
